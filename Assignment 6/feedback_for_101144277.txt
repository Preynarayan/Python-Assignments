Overall: 72/80 - 90%
Code Design, Packaging: 12/13
Approach: 22/26
Execution: 38/41


[Code Design] -1: Too many magic numbers, use constant definitions 
[Execution] -3: get_data allows either too many values, does not quit from the program as specified, or does not print a nice error message to the user.
[Approach] -4: Arrays not correctly declared in the main function
